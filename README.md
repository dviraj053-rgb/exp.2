Aim:
The primary aim of this experiment is to comprehensively understand the fundamental characteristics, functionalities, and common operations associated with lists in Python.

Theory and Concepts Explored:
Through the various code snippets, the following theoretical aspects and practical applications of Python lists have been explored:

List Creation and Data Types: Demonstrating how to initialize lists and store various data types (strings, integers, floats, booleans) within a single list.
Indexing and Slicing: Understanding how to access individual elements using positive and negative indices, and how to extract sub-lists using slicing.
List Length: Utilizing the len() function to determine the number of elements in a list.
Mutability: Illustrating that lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed, added, or removed after the list's creation.
Adding Elements: Experimenting with methods like append() to add elements to the end and insert() to add elements at a specific position.
Extending Lists: Using the extend() method to combine elements from one list into another.
Duplicate Elements: Confirming that lists can contain multiple instances of the same value.
Built-in Functions for Lists: Applying functions such as max(), min(), sum(), and len() to perform aggregate calculations on numerical lists.
Sorting Lists: Demonstrating how to sort list elements in ascending order using the sort() method.
